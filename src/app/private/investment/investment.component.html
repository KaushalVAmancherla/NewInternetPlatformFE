            <p>This page will allow the user to determine the relative importance of all the categories/topics on the
              platform. It is called "investment" since the relative importance of categories determines the PS of posts
              on the platform (as described in the calculation pdf). The importance of each category will then be
              determined according to the "vote" of all users on the Platform (of course, the weight of each user's
              "vote" is based on that user's CS * PS)</p>
